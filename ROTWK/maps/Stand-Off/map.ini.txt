PSYCH!!!!!

No map.ini for this one!

So, yeah, I guess this is the Readme then.  This is Stand-Off.  Fortresses in the North
and South, choose wisely, as each has its own advantages and disadvatages.  It's supposed
to be a 2vs2 map, but if you're daring, play a free for all.  Unlimited cash, 2000 CP, it
will get laggy so turn your settings down for online play!  That's it!
