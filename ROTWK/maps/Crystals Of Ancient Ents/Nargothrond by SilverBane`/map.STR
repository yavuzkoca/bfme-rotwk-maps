"Welcome to the great underground fortress on the river Narog - Nargothrond... \n The caves that were once used by dwarves now belong to Ordodreth and his elves... \n They have no idea that soon their kingdom will fall under Glaurung's might..."

SCRIPT:2
"Get ready, warrior! \n Sooner or later Morgoth's armies will take control over Nargothrond, and you decide if you let that happen today or not! \n Map by SilverBane - good luck and have fun!"
